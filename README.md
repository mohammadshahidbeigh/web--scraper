# Web Scraping with LangChain Toola

## Introduction

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to perform web scraping using LangChain tools. Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites, and it can be useful for various purposes such as data analysis, content aggregation, and research.

In this example, we'll be scraping my college website ([MIET Jammu](https://www.mietjmu.in/)) to extract information such as page titles, URLs, and content.

## Setup

Before running the script, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the following dependencies:

- `beautifulsoup4`: A Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.
- `langchain_community`: LangChain community tools for web scraping.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

## pip install beautifulsoup4 langchain_community


## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

3. **Run the Script**: Run the Python script (`scrape_website.py`) using the following command:



## python scrape_website.py


This script will scrape the MIET Jammu website and save the scraped data to a text file (`scraped_data.txt`).

## Customization

You can customize the scraping process by modifying the script according to your requirements. Here are a few customization options:

- **URL**: Change the URL in the script to scrape a different website.
- **Extractor Function**: Customize the `custom_extractor` function to extract specific content from the web pages.
- **Formatting**: Modify the formatting rules to format the scraped data according to your preferences.
