# LangChain Text File Formatter

This LangChain tool allows you to format a text file according to specified rules. You can use this tool to achieve consistent formatting for your text documents, making them easier to read and analyze.

## How it Works

The tool reads the content of an input text file, applies formatting rules, and writes the formatted content to an output file. You can customize the formatting rules according to your specific requirements.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Script**: Run the Python script to format your text file. Replace `"input.txt"` with the path to your input text file and `"formatted_output.txt"` with the desired name and path for the formatted output file.

    ```
    python format_text.py
    ```

5. **Check the Output**: Once the script has finished running, you can check the formatted output file to see the result.

## Customization

You can customize the formatting rules by modifying the `format_text` function in the `format_text.py` file. Adjust the regular expressions and formatting logic to achieve the desired formatting for your text files.

## Example

Here's an example of how you can use the tool to format a text file:

```python
# Example usage:
input_file = "input.txt"
output_file = "formatted_output.txt"
format_text(input_file, output_file)
