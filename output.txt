What  our Alumni say...
“Being part of the MIET has been one of the defining moments in my journey towards success.
The technical exposure that I got here and the excellent opportunity provided by college of interning at Hewlett-Packard (HP), Bangalore under the "HP-University Student's Program'06" made me industry ready and fostered in me the importance and need for innovation and sound understanding of the products end-to-end.
The excellent guidance got from Dr.
Ankur Gupta, HOD, Computer Science made us finish 3rd in final conference for the HP project undertaken by us, out of 20 different colleges across India.
And, as always, hard work results in excellent results.
I was offered a full-time opportunity at HP, where I worked for 5 years."Swapan Shridhar     2003 Batch

“Its dedicated faculty, good infrastructure, state-of-the-art laboratories and talent pool in terms of students, along with its quality policy have made MIET what it is today - the most sought after engineering college in the State.
Almost 10 years ago (Oh time just flies away!) when I entered this college, there were just dreams and aspirations in my mind, but support from MIET and my personal efforts made it a reality today.
The way this college prepares students to face global competition and come out successful is unique and unmatched.
Along with imparting quality education, this college gives a lot of opportunities to develop and demonstrate leadership skills, creativity and presentation skills through the various events organized.”Ruchieka Sharma    2002 Batch

“Its been 10 years since i graduated from MIET but the umbilical cord remains protected & active as it was many years back.
When I look back to reflect what made me reach where i am today, I clearly see the crucial role that MIET played in my evolution, from a shy student to becoming a young leader.
The visionary leadership team, our passionate & always accessible faculty, state of the art facilities and of course, diverse student base @ MIET are a perfect recipe for the candidates keen to pursue Engineering & Management studies.
In a country where Engineering colleges mushroom everywhere, what differentiates this institution from others is its progressive outlook, its ability to recognize the changes driving the new world & re-aligning accordingly and its constant pursuit towards challenging the status quo.”Vikram Goel   2002 Batch

“MIET was the 1st platform that gave wings to my career.
I feel lucky to get into MIET.
The course curriculum is same as any other college but what distinguishes MIET from the rest is the close relationship of its leadership team with the industry.
Students get many opportunities to work on real life industry projects in addition to regular coursework.
Under the able guidance of Dr.
Ankur Gupta MIET is destined to become an educational center of excellence in India in times to come.
It is already the best engineering college in the State of J&K.
I am keen followers on MIET Face book page and looking at the events being held like cultural events, assistance in placements, health insurance coverage, personnel email ids on MIET domain.
” Bharat Mahajan    2003 Batch

I thank MIET for giving me such unforgettable sweet memories, everlasting knowledge.
I am grateful to the teachers of MIET especially Ankur Sir who have always encouraged us to bring the best out of us so that we could achieve the best in life...
the 4 yrs I spent at MIET were the best days of my life...I not only enjoyed but also gained oodles of knowledge which is helping me now.
” Sumit Malhotra    2003 Batch

“It's been a pleasure to be part of MIET family.
The MIET that I knew has grown by leaps and bounds from the time it was established.
In such a short time the institution has made tremendous progress, from achieving several firsts in the state.
Firsts among the private institutions in state to have dedicated internet labs, first among the private institutions in the state to enter into collaborations with several multinationals or be it the first institution in the state to achieve ISO rating.
Speaking of firsts there is one distinction that no one can take from me.
I am in the first person to enroll in the MIET family, being the Roll No.
1 for the very first batch of MIET.
Looking back retrospectively I cherish it.
I can never forget the support we got from our teachers especially Saleem sir and Bhawani sir for electrical labs."Wajid B Munshi     2003 Batch

“I started my journey around 15 years back, Came out of normal education background, I got the needed confidence at MIET that i too can compete and excel in life.
I owe all my success to my tenure at MIET.
MIET is one the best college in state.
Its uniqueness lies in equal focus on acamedics and overall personal development.
The faculty at MIET is one of the very best and their goal is to make you a confident and matured professional.
Once you come out of the college, you have the confidence to take the world on their own and make successfull carreer in different fields.

Infact i personally got campus placed way back in 2005 and things have only improved from that point onwards."Vishay Gupta     2001 Batch

“My 4 years at MIET were really enlightening for me in both personal as well professional fronts.
I underwent a complete transition from a core academic student to an individual filled with a glutton for exposure.
Within the first few months, I realized that besides having a good academic teaching staff, MIET was also having a bunch of opportunities for students to groom and emerge as a better professional being.
Frequent workshops, seminars, presentations, alumni lectures, mentorship programs, personality development sessions, adventurous camps, industrial exposure from companies like Aircel, Nokia HERE etc, were a few pearls of opportunity out of the treasure house.
The college helped me to inculcate a sense of being something “Out of the Crowd” in myself."Rajet Veshin  2012 Batch

"As I jot down my thoughts about MIET, my Alma mater, 5.5 years after stepping out of its premises, one core strength which seems to dawn on me now is the unsaid spirit of entrepreneurship embedded in its DNA.
It is this spirit which has translated many of its students into dynamic, self driven leaders proving their mettle in big organizations across the globe.
And it doesn't take big management programs to inculcate this DNA for success.
What it takes is the trust that MIET shows in its students to take up various initiatives, give them the freedom to drive on their own, allow them to fail & encourage them to get up & do it better the next time.
This is something which I went through during my tenure at MIET - a tenure which transformed a shy boy into a well socializing, dynamic student."
Dr Zakir Hussain  2005 Batch

My four years in MIET has been truly amazing and instrumental in providing 360-degree transformation to my attitude, skills, and knowledge.

I would like to extend my gratitude towards faculty members and management for their continuous support throughout 4 years.
I would end by saying Future Begins at MIET."

What  our Alumni say...
“Being part of the MIET has been one of the defining moments in my journey towards success.
The technical exposure that I got here and the excellent opportunity provided by college of interning at Hewlett-Packard (HP), Bangalore under the "HP-University Student's Program'06" made me industry ready and fostered in me the importance and need for innovation and sound understanding of the products end-to-end.
The excellent guidance got from Dr.
Ankur Gupta, HOD, Computer Science made us finish 3rd in final conference for the HP project undertaken by us, out of 20 different colleges across India.
And, as always, hard work results in excellent results.
I was offered a full-time opportunity at HP, where I worked for 5 years."Swapan Shridhar     2003 Batch

“Its dedicated faculty, good infrastructure, state-of-the-art laboratories and talent pool in terms of students, along with its quality policy have made MIET what it is today - the most sought after engineering college in the State.
Almost 10 years ago (Oh time just flies away!) when I entered this college, there were just dreams and aspirations in my mind, but support from MIET and my personal efforts made it a reality today.
The way this college prepares students to face global competition and come out successful is unique and unmatched.
Along with imparting quality education, this college gives a lot of opportunities to develop and demonstrate leadership skills, creativity and presentation skills through the various events organized.”Ruchieka Sharma    2002 Batch

“Its been 10 years since i graduated from MIET but the umbilical cord remains protected & active as it was many years back.
When I look back to reflect what made me reach where i am today, I clearly see the crucial role that MIET played in my evolution, from a shy student to becoming a young leader.
The visionary leadership team, our passionate & always accessible faculty, state of the art facilities and of course, diverse student base @ MIET are a perfect recipe for the candidates keen to pursue Engineering & Management studies.
In a country where Engineering colleges mushroom everywhere, what differentiates this institution from others is its progressive outlook, its ability to recognize the changes driving the new world & re-aligning accordingly and its constant pursuit towards challenging the status quo.”Vikram Goel   2002 Batch

“MIET was the 1st platform that gave wings to my career.
I feel lucky to get into MIET.
The course curriculum is same as any other college but what distinguishes MIET from the rest is the close relationship of its leadership team with the industry.
Students get many opportunities to work on real life industry projects in addition to regular coursework.
Under the able guidance of Dr.
Ankur Gupta MIET is destined to become an educational center of excellence in India in times to come.
It is already the best engineering college in the State of J&K.
I am keen followers on MIET Face book page and looking at the events being held like cultural events, assistance in placements, health insurance coverage, personnel email ids on MIET domain.
” Bharat Mahajan    2003 Batch

“The extracurricular activities at MIET have helped in enhancing my technical as well as communication skills.
The college hs always encouraged sports spirit of students and organized many sports events which always refreshed us.
College canteen was the place where all the planning about the future took place in tne most natural environment.
I thank MIET for giving me such unforgettable sweet memories, everlasting knowledge.
I am grateful to the teachers of MIET especially Ankur Sir who have always encouraged us to bring the best out of us so that we could achieve the best in life...
the 4 yrs I spent at MIET were the best days of my life...I not only enjoyed but also gained oodles of knowledge which is helping me now.
” Sumit Malhotra    2003 Batch

“It's been a pleasure to be part of MIET family.
The MIET that I knew has grown by leaps and bounds from the time it was established.
In such a short time the institution has made tremendous progress, from achieving several firsts in the state.
Firsts among the private institutions in state to have dedicated internet labs, first among the private institutions in the state to enter into collaborations with several multinationals or be it the first institution in the state to achieve ISO rating.
Speaking of firsts there is one distinction that no one can take from me.
I am in the first person to enroll in the MIET family, being the Roll No.
1 for the very first batch of MIET.
Looking back retrospectively I cherish it.
I can never forget the support we got from our teachers especially Saleem sir and Bhawani sir for electrical labs."Wajid B Munshi     2003 Batch

“I started my journey around 15 years back, Came out of normal education background, I got the needed confidence at MIET that i too can compete and excel in life.
I owe all my success to my tenure at MIET.
MIET is one the best college in state.
Its uniqueness lies in equal focus on acamedics and overall personal development.
The faculty at MIET is one of the very best and their goal is to make you a confident and matured professional.
Once you come out of the college, you have the confidence to take the world on their own and make successfull carreer in different fields.
Talking about Campus placement, the rate of placements is one of best in the state.
Over a period of time, it is getting improved year by year because comapnies trust the kind of talent they are getting there.
Infact i personally got campus placed way back in 2005 and things have only improved from that point onwards."Vishay Gupta     2001 Batch

“My 4 years at MIET were really enlightening for me in both personal as well professional fronts.
I underwent a complete transition from a core academic student to an individual filled with a glutton for exposure.
Within the first few months, I realized that besides having a good academic teaching staff, MIET was also having a bunch of opportunities for students to groom and emerge as a better professional being.
Frequent workshops, seminars, presentations, alumni lectures, mentorship programs, personality development sessions, adventurous camps, industrial exposure from companies like Aircel, Nokia HERE etc, were a few pearls of opportunity out of the treasure house.
The college helped me to inculcate a sense of being something “Out of the Crowd” in myself."Rajet Veshin  2012 Batch

"As I jot down my thoughts about MIET, my Alma mater, 5.5 years after stepping out of its premises, one core strength which seems to dawn on me now is the unsaid spirit of entrepreneurship embedded in its DNA.
It is this spirit which has translated many of its students into dynamic, self driven leaders proving their mettle in big organizations across the globe.
And it doesn't take big management programs to inculcate this DNA for success.
What it takes is the trust that MIET shows in its students to take up various initiatives, give them the freedom to drive on their own, allow them to fail & encourage them to get up & do it better the next time.
This is something which I went through during my tenure at MIET - a tenure which transformed a shy boy into a well socializing, dynamic student."
Dr Zakir Hussain  2005 Batch

"My name is Sumant and have completed my B.E in Computer Science Engineering.
My four years in MIET has been truly amazing and instrumental in providing 360-degree transformation to my attitude, skills, and knowledge.

I would like to extend my gratitude towards faculty members and management for their continuous support throughout 4 years.
I would end by saying Future Begins at MIET."

Chairperson Message 

Dr.
Renu GuptaChairperson MIER Group

It gives me immense pleasure to pen down the introductory message for the Model Institute of Engineering and Technology (MIET), which has carved a niche for itself amongst the 3500+ engineering institutions in the country.
MIET has the proud distinction of being the first Engineering College in the private sector in the State of Jammu and Kashmir.
Established in 1999 MIET has evolved into a center of quality education and training for engineers.
It is the only technical institution in J&K to be accredited with “A” Grade by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC).
The department of CSE is currently accredited by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) from 2019-25.
MIET also finds place in the top 100 T-schools of India in the 2021 DataQuest survey, while the MIET School of Management figures in the top 100 B-Schools, ranked at 52nd spot in the Return-on-Investment category by Business Today.
MIET is also the first Autonomous College of Engineering in J&K, a matter of great pride for us.
MIET recently received the MIET received the Special Jury Award for Best Partner Institution at the UiPath Academic Alliance Awards and New Code of Education Award for Digital Excellence and figured in the Top Autonomous Colleges in India.
It is also the recipient of the prestigious Quality Council of India’s D.L Shaw Platinum Award for Quality and the RICOH Education Excellence Award for “Best use of technology in student services”.
MIET was ranked in the Top 10 at the India Innovation Initiative organized by DST, AICTE and CII, receiving the Startup Board Award, while it received the “Outstanding Technical Institution Award in North India” by NITTTR Chandigarh.
MIET carries forward the glorious legacy of the MIER (Model Institute of Education and Research) Group spanning 89 years.
MIER also operates the MIER College of Education, J&K's first autonomous College of Education besides “Model Academy”, J&Ks oldest private school.
Thus, the MIER group has a recorded history of educational leadership and demonstrated commitment to quality over 8 decades.
MIET has signed MoUs with the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC), USA, University of Florida, USA, Aurel Vlaicu University, Romania and IIT Jammu for various collaborative initiatives.
It has established strong industry linkages with Amazon, IBM, Cisco, Dell-EMC, Microsoft, UiPath, Bentley & Mitsubishi.
Through these linkages students and faculty are trained on emerging technologies like cloud computing, AI, cyber security, Industry 4.0 and networking, making them industry-ready.
This has resulted in best placement in J&K.
During 2020-2021, 50 students received packages of over 10 Lakhs per annum across a range of companies.
Our faculty is actively engaged in Research and Development with 49 patents filed in the last few years and over 800 research papers published in credible international and national publications.
The International Journal on Next-Generation Computing indexed by Web of Science is also published out of MIET.
Two IT products have also been incubated at the Center for Software Development.
In coming years our stakeholders can expect us to push the boundaries further.
We promise to keep innovating and executing well.

Title: Research Awards and Research Promotion Scheme.
Goal: To create a culture of promoting quality research at MIET.
The Context: Research is an integral component of higher technical education but producing quality research output remains challenging.
For an institution, such as MIET, which offers primarily undergraduate courses in Engineering, getting research activities off the ground requires an innovative strategy to be formulated.
The Practice: The Research Promotion Scheme at MIET provides financial incentives to faculty and students for their research output besides providing financial support in attending conferences, paying registration fees etc.
The Annual Research Awards recognize the researchers and help celebrate individual/group achievements.
Evidence of Success: 650+ research papers published by faculty to date with 60% in international journals and conferences, 26 patents filed, 2 patents granted, 2 IT products incubated, 3 mobile applications developed.
Problems Encountered and Resources Required: Overcoming inertia, creating awareness about the benefits of research in career development and growth, creating a budget for research and demonstrating an institutional commitment to research, the low fee structure was a hindrance in creating facilities/resources for research.
Notes: This best practice is unique to MIET in the state of J&K making it the only private institution which has a credible research output and culture which supports faculty research.

CASH (Committee Against Sexual Harassment)

CASH (Committee Against Sexual Harassment) at MIET has been formed to provide a place of work and study free of sexual harassment, intimidation or exploitation.
This committee is the instrument for addressing issues/grievances/cases of sexual harassment and recommending their redressal.
Keeping in view the  Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) Act, 2013  Model Institute of Engineering and Technology has formulated a committee against Sexual Harassment (CASH) .
It is in this spirit that the institute expects that its entire community i.e.
students, faculty and staff are treated with respect and they are protected against sexual harassment.
All members of the college community, including those who are in temporary or short-term positions are subject to this policy.
Anyone violating this policy is subject to disciplinary action.
The committee believes that freedom comes with the responsibility of not encroaching upon another's freedom.
Function
The committee has three major functions:

Educate and sensitize faculty and staff about sexual harassment.
Preventive action, Crisis Management, mediation and counsel.
Formal enquiry, redressal and feedback.
Objectives

 To develop the guidelines and norms for the policy against sexual harassment.
To develop principles and procedures for combating sexual harassment.
To work out details for the implementation of the policy.
To prepare a detailed plan of action, both short and long-term.
To protect all the students and employees of MIET

Message from
Prof.
Ankur Gupta, Director, MIET
At MIET, Jammu we are extremely proud of our alumni and their outstanding professional accomplishments.
MIET alumni are truly global, working with the best organizations across continents in diverse domains and roles, from FAANG companies in the USA to the top corporate houses in India.
The MIET family keeps growing and progressing.
To remain connected with our alumni and build a tight knit community, we are launching the MIET alumni virtual community on the AlmaConnect platform.
This platform not only allows all alumni to remain connected with their alma mater, but also with each other.
Features like alumni networking, searching for your batchmates, job posts and latest updates from MIET, will ensure that there is something of interest for everyone.
MIET is at an inflection point.
Post the grant of Autonomous status by the University Grants Commission, MIET is rapidly expanding its course offerings and value proposition while seeking to evolve into a research driven institution.
It is an exciting time for the institution as it races towards completing its silver jubilee (25 years) in 2024.
Now is the best time as any to reconnect the entire alumni family together starting with the first batch onwards.
I extend a warm invite to all MIET alumni to join the MIET community on AlmaConnect.
Lets Connect, Empower and Grow!

Connexions - Alumni Association
Connexions is the official Alumni Association of MIET which has been formally registered in 2016.
The association will serve to further the interests of the student/alumni community of MIET through several key initiatives.
It is envisioned to become a significant stakeholder in creating a strategic future direction for MIET.
As a first step, many of the senior alumni have been drafted in to serve on the Advisory Boards for individual departments.
In 2015, a Bengaluru Chapter of the Alumni Association was established.
It is planned to set up small alumni chapters in all major cities of India and internationally as well.
Dear Alumni, Kindly register yourself in Alumni Association Click here

As a practice, every year Cell organizes Alumni meet in Jammu near the festival of Diwali to felicitate Distinguished Alumni Award Winners and to create a forum for all alumni to refresh their memories of college days.
The invitation and registration process starts for alumni meet start well 3 months before the event to give sufficient time for the alumni to plan for the event.

The adoption of the tool since 2014 (for students) has proved immensely beneficial for the departments and management in making strategic interventions at the right time as per the student requirements.
Student Services and Amenities
MIET provides several services for the student community.
Some of the prominent services are  listed below:

The MIET cafeteria is a unique experience set amidst lush green foliage with huts made out of eco-friendly and bio-degradable natural long grass.
Highly acclaimed by students it offers hygienic and quality food.
Apart from the canteen food kiosks are also set up at multiple places to meet student’s requirements.
Common Room: Students can avail of the facilities of the common room to refresh themselves from their rigorous class work by participating in various indoor sports options such as Table tennis, Carroms, and Chess are offered in the room.

I-Survive: is a unique initiative primarily targeted at the youth for attitude shaping and developing life skills.
The idea is to take students out of their comfort zones and instil in them new attitudes, and fresh ideas and motivate them to cultivate essential survival skills to succeed in today's competitive world.
The "I Survive" camp set in a picturesque location at Patnitop - a premier hill station in J&K - is equipped with modern tents and all basic amenities giving the participants a unique outdoor experience.
MIET organizes “I-Survive Boot-camp” in the early spring and encouraged participation from all the students across all batches.
It is a one-of-a-kind initiative that focuses on developing life skills among students through adventure sports and activities.
Apart from providing an adrenalin rush these activities also imparted key learnings pertaining to overcoming individual fear and mental blocks, pushing yourself and testing your limits, and finally trusting others and working as a team.
Fun along with a sense of discipline, time management, rebuilding relationships, team spirit, endurance and zilch idleness

 

Student Clubs: At MIET education is a journey of exploring both the self and the world around.
It goes beyond the confines of the classroom and curriculum.
In order to promote the wholesome personal and academic development of its students, the institute has set up a number of clubs and societies covering diverse interests, ranging from Literary, Entrepreneurship, Quiz, Music, Theatre, and Dance.
These clubs organize various events and workshops throughout the year which ensures that the extra-curricular scene at MIET  is always dynamic and exciting.
Apart from providing an avenue for students to showcase their immense talents, these clubs also encourage students to take the initiative in organizing events and set new standards of excellence.
These are clubs “of the students, by the students, for the students”.
